        <p id="about">Hi! My name is Ryan Lester. I have lived most of my life in Colonial Heights, Virginia and attended James Madison University in Harrisonburg.  My list of hobbies are still expanding; I am practicing guitar
        and chess, enjoy reading fiction and nonfiction books, and am hoping to get back into hiking as the weather warms up.</p>
        <p>My brother has inspired me to explore the tech industry so I am currently training in full-stack web development.  Looking forward to learn about the back-end of the stack.</p>
